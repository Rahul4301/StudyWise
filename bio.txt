Mitosis is the fundamental process by which a single eukaryotic cell divides to produce two genetically identical daughter cells. It is essential for growth, tissue maintenance, wound healing, and asexual reproduction in many organisms. Although often taught as a sequence of neat stages, mitosis is actually a highly regulated, dynamic, and mechanically complex process that integrates chromosome biochemistry, microtubule mechanics, motor proteins, membrane remodeling, and cell cycle control. Below is a thorough exploration of mitosis, covering its stages, molecular machinery, regulation, common errors and consequences, experimental observations, and broader biological relevance.

Overview and purpose

At its core, mitosis ensures accurate segregation of the duplicated genome. Before mitosis begins the cell goes through interphase, during which DNA is replicated in S phase and duplicated chromosomes are packaged as sister chromatids held together by cohesin complexes. The cell also grows, accumulates energy and building blocks, and checks for DNA damage. Entry into mitosis marks the transition from a replicated, interphase state to the active process of segregating chromosomes and physically dividing the cell.

Mitosis must achieve two main objectives:

Faithful partitioning of one copy of each chromosome into each daughter cell.

Preservation of cell viability and appropriate distribution of cytoplasmic contents, organelles, and membrane.

Failure in either objective can cause aneuploidy, cell death, or disease such as cancer.

Stages of mitosis

Although many textbooks list prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, these stages reflect observable structural changes. The biochemical events that drive those changes are continuous and highly coordinated.

Prophase

Prophase is the first visible stage of mitosis. Chromatin begins to condense into discrete chromosomes that can be resolved by light microscopy. Each duplicated chromosome now consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere by cohesin proteins. Centrosomes, which have duplicated during interphase, separate and begin to nucleate microtubules, establishing the nascent bipolar spindle. Many regulatory proteins are activated at this stage, most notably cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) bound to cyclin B. CDK1 activity triggers phosphorylation cascades that promote chromatin condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown preparation, and spindle assembly factors.

Prometaphase

During prometaphase the nuclear envelope breaks down in most animal cells, allowing spindle microtubules to access chromosomes. Microtubules attach to chromosomes at specialized protein assemblies called kinetochores. Each sister chromatid has its own kinetochore, and correct attachment means sister kinetochores are attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles, a configuration called amphitelic or biorientation. Attachment is dynamic. Microtubules grow and shrink while kinetochore-associated motors and microtubule-associated proteins stabilize correct attachments and destabilize incorrect ones. The dynamic instability of microtubules is essential; it provides the force and search mechanism needed to capture kinetochores.

Metaphase

Metaphase is defined by chromosomes aligned along the metaphase plate, an imaginary plane equidistant from the two spindle poles. This alignment results from balanced forces on kinetochores produced by microtubule dynamics and motor proteins. The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is active at this stage. The SAC monitors kinetochore attachment and tension, and prevents the onset of anaphase until every chromosome is properly attached and under appropriate tension. The SAC accomplishes this by inhibiting the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) when errors are detected.

Anaphase

Anaphase begins when APC/C, activated by Cdc20 once the SAC is satisfied, ubiquitinates securin leading to its proteasomal degradation. Degradation of securin frees separase, a protease that cleaves cohesin complexes holding sister chromatids together. Once cohesin is removed, sister chromatids separate and are pulled toward opposite spindle poles. Two processes contribute to chromatid segregation. First, kinetochore microtubules shorten by depolymerization at their plus ends and sometimes at the minus ends near poles. Second, interpolar microtubules slide past one another by the action of motor proteins like kinesin-5, elongating the spindle and pushing poles apart. Anaphase is often subdivided into anaphase A, dominated by chromatid movement toward poles, and anaphase B, dominated by spindle elongation.

Telophase and cytokinesis

During telophase separated chromatids arrive at spindle poles and begin to decondense back into less compact chromatin. Nuclear envelope reformation occurs around each set of chromosomes. Simultaneously, cytokinesis physically divides the cytoplasm. In animal cells cytokinesis is achieved by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring at the cell equator, forming a cleavage furrow that deepens until the two cells separate. In plant cells a cell plate forms from vesicles delivered along the phragmoplast, eventually forming a new cell wall between daughters. Proper coordination between mitosis and cytokinesis is essential so that nuclei are enclosed in daughter cells.
